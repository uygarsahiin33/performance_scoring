# Performance Scoring System

This project focuses on building a **statistical model-based performance scoring system** to dynamically and parametrically evaluate **store and employee performances**. It utilizes **chi-square significance testing** and **clustering algorithms** to generate actionable and data-driven performance insights.

---

##  Project Objective

To provide companies with a **data-driven**, **objective**, and **flexible scoring framework** for tracking and improving store and employee performance.

---

## Methods Used
-  **Chi-Square Tests**: Testing the statistical significance of various performance metrics.
-  **Clustering**: Segmenting stores and employees into performance groups based on behavioral patterns.
-  **Dynamic Scoring System**: Generating parametrically weighted performance scores adaptable to business objectives.

##  Methodology

The scoring process follows a structured, multi-step approach combining statistical validation, distribution-based scoring, and weighted aggregation.

- 🟣 **Step 1: Distribution Identification via Chi-Square Test**
    - Five key performance metrics are analyzed using **Chi-Square significance tests** to understand their distributional behavior.
    - Metrics are classified into:
        - **Beta Distribution (3 metrics)**: Metrics with skewed or bounded distributions (e.g., complete order rate).
        - **Normal Distribution (2 metrics)**: Metrics displaying symmetric bell-shaped distributions (e.g. customer complaint rate)

- 🟣 **Step 2: Scoring via Percentile and Sigma Buckets**
    - Each metric is **ranked from worst to best**. The goal is to score each metric from 0 to 5.
    - For **Beta-distributed metrics**:
        - Scoring follows percentile brackets (0–5%, 5–15%, ..., 95–100%) with scores from **0 to 5**.
    - For **Normally-distributed metrics**:
        - Scoring follows **standard deviation intervals** (e.g., μ ± σ ranges), assigning points based on distance from the mean.

- 🟣 **Step 3: Weighted Aggregation of Scores**
    - Each metric is assigned a **business-priority weight**. The business-priority weight is determined based on the evaluation of blind-ranking results conducted by company experts.
    - The final **weighted average performance score** is computed by multiplying each metric score with its respective weight.

This methodology ensures **fair**, **distribution-sensitive**, and **dynamic performance scoring**, offering reliable insights for store and employee performance tracking.
